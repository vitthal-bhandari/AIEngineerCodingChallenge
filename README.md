# Solve Intelligence AI Engineer Challenge

## Objective

You have received a mock-up of a patent reviewing application from a junior colleague. Unfortunately, it is incomplete and needs additional work. Your job is to take your colleague's work, improve and extend it, and add a feature of your own creation!

## Docker

Make sure you create a .env file (see .env.example) with the OpenAI API key we have provided.

To build and run the application using Docker, execute the following command:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Task 1: Implement Document Versioning

Currently, the user can save a document, but there is no concept of **versioning**. Paying customers have expressed an interest in this and have requested the following:

1. The ability to create new versions
2. The ability to switch between existing versions
3. The ability to make changes to any of the existing versions and save those changes (without creating a new version)

You will need to modify the database model (`app/models.py`), add some API routes (`app/__main__.py`), and update the client-side code accordingly.

## Task 2: Real-Time AI Suggestions

Your colleague started some work on integrating real-time improvement suggestions for your users. However, they only had time to set up a WebSocket connection. It is your job to finish it.

You will find a WebSocket endpoint that needs to be completed in the `app/__main__.py` file in the `server`. This endpoint should receive the editor contents from the client and stream out AI suggestions to the UI. There are a few complications here:

- You are using a third party AI library, which exposes a fairly poor API. The code for this library is in `server/app/internal/ai.py`.
  - The API expects a **plain** text document, with no HTML mark-up or formatting
  - There are intermittent errors in the formatting of the JSON output

You will need to find some way of notifying the user of the suggestions generated. As we don't want the user's experience to be impacted, this should be a background process. You can find the existing frontend WebSocket code in `client/src/Document.tsx`.

## Task 3: Showcase your AI Skills

Implement an additional AI-based feature or product improvement that would benefit our customers as they draft their patent applications.

This last part is open-ended, and you can take it in any direction you like. We’re interested in seeing how you come up with and implement AI-based approaches without us directing you.

Some ideas:
- Generate technical drawings (e.g. flowcharts, system diagrams, device diagrams, etc.) based on the claims.
- Have the user ask the AI to make an update to the application, and have the AI stream this update directly into the editor.
- Extend task 2 by having the AI incorporate its suggestions directly into the editor.

Or anything else you like.

Enjoy!
